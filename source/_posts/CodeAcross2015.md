title: CodeAcross2015 Recap

Code for OKC hosted its first CodeAcross hack event! This weekend was all about OKC citizens working together to improve the city by using technology. Plus, we had a lot of fun.

So what is a CodeAcross event? CodeAcross is a weekend dedicated to civic hacking, created by Code for America. The theme for this weekend was [Principles for 21st Century Government](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/). 

We held our event at Prototek in Midtown on Saturday February 21 from 10am-4pm. Ready with donuts and coffee, we kicked off our event with some local speakers discussing the coding languages we’d use to make our apps. [Darren Jaworski](http://darrenjaworski.com/#/) gave an insightful and entertaining talk on D3, a JavaScript library. During CodeAcross, we used D3 to create a visual representation of Oklahoma City’s 2015 budget plan. All of our projects can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/codeforokc) page. 

[Karl Kirch](https://twitter.com/joekarl) also spoke during CodeAcross. He is leading our School-Finder app. This app is growing to include more than just “what school district am I in.” This app will include other city services like close by police stations and libraries.  

Another goal of our CodeAcross event was to fill out the [Local Digital Services Census](https://service-census.herokuapp.com/). This survey is a shorter version of the [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/). What exactly are these sites? They can be described as an open data report card. How open is Oklahoma City with its data? By answering the questions on these sites, OKC is graded and listed among other participating cities. 

What did we learn from this event? We learned that Code for OKC is more than just about writing code. We learned how to implement one of our goals—to create a safe environment where people can explore new ideas. We’re learning how to build relationships with local government entities. And of course, we learned how to code D3 and make really cool graphics that show OKC’s budget data. Come to our meetings and be apart of the open data movement. You can see our meeting announcements on our [MeetUp page](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-OKC/).
