## [School Finder](https://github.com/codeforokc/school-finder)

Our first development project is an app that will allow people to use either geo-location or a street address to find which school district serves a particular location.

We've started to work through the process of mapping out the application and there are several discussions happening in the ["issues" area of the github repo](https://github.com/codeforokc/school-finder/issues). Please feel free to join in the discussion there.

We're also working on contributing data to the Open Census Data project for the OKC area. [You can follow the progress and find ways to help with this effort here](https://github.com/codeforokc/discussions/issues/4).
