Our first development project is an app that will allow people to use either geo-location or a street address to find which school district serves a particular location.

We've started to work through the process of mapping out the application and there are several discussions happening in the ["issues" area of the github repo](https://github.com/codeforokc/school-finder/issues). Please feel free to join in the discussion there.
